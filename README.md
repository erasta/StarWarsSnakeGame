# Star Wars Snake Game
A Star Wars themed snake game, using Python3.<br>
Requires pygame and dataclasses.

The goal is to collect the Jedi, and avoid the Sith.<br>
A Sith breaks the snake, so be careful. This also means you can play forever :)<br>
For your convenience, the Jedi are in blue frames, and the Sith are in red frames.<br>

Move the snake: up/down/left/right arrow keys, or 'W','S','A','D', respectively.<br>
Adjust Snake's speed: '+' and '-'.

May The Force Be With You.<br>
